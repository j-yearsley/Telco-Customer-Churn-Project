# Telco Customer Churn Project

## About
This project aims to tackle the customer churn problem faced by many service providers such as telecoms companies.</br></br>
I will look to train Machine Learning models to predict customer churn. This data is invaluable within businesses to ensure that resources are allocated efficiently to retain the highest number of customers.</br></br>
The workflow process can be followed step-by-step in the uploaded Jupyter Notebook.
